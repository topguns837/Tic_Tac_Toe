# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game which can be played using hand gestures.


This is a Python based  project which uses hand gestures to give classical games like tic tac toe an exciting touch.

I have used a module name cvzone for hand detection and hand gestures detecttion.

TUTORIAL: These are some tips you should know before using this project 
          
          1) Your hand should be about 90 cms away from the camera for best precision.
          
          2) Use your phone as a camera for better camera quality . Otherwise , change the line 26 to "cap=cv2.VideoCapture(0)" .
          
          3) Move your index finger such that it is on one of the 9 tiles and move your middle finger closer to the index finger
          to register a move. 

          4) A counter at top right will keep track of whose turn it is to reduce confusion.
          
          5) The program will declare the winner itself !
          
          
          
Reequirements : The modules used in this project are given below :
              
               1) cv2
               
               2) cvzone
               
               3) time
               
               4) numpy
               
               5) pandas
               
               
               
 The idea for this project is inspired from " Murtaza's Workshop's " Youtube video named "AI Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV " .
